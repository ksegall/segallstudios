    <p>
      I was born in Jacksonville, Florida and have lived in Central Florida the majority of my life.  As a young child I treasured my art supplies.  
      My mother would ask me to clean up after working on an art project and I would organize my crayons, markers and colored pencils according to the different hues. 
      I remember my mother showing friends and family how my crayons would look before and after I started a project.  
      My artwork would have to be perfect in every way.  
      I would spend my days coloring with my grandmother or creating a craft with my mom.
      I, like most artists, are my own critic.  With every task I aspire to greatness.  This has been my motto.

After graduating from the University of South Florida I went to work at a t-shirt printing company that did graphic designing for corporations.  
      This reshaped my thinking about my career life.  
      I knew that I needed to follow my heart so I applied for the graphic design program at Seminole State.  
      I have created videos to help a non-profit organization and graphic designs to promote businesses.

I am currently a student at Seminole State completing a certification in graphic design and soon will be attending the University of Central Florida to earn a second bachelorâ€™s degree. 
      I am an eager, conscientious, hard working artist.  I am Sara Segall.
