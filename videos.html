    <h2>Pet Rescue by Judy</h2>
    
    <p>
      In this video, I questioned and gathered information to determine the needs of the client. In this case, Judy, the owner
      of Pet Rescue by Judy, wanted to sponser an educational video of how to reduce the number of homeless dogs. She wanted to focus on 
      the importance of doing your research before adopting a dog so it won't get returned because of the owner being unprepared and the imporantce
      of spaying and nuetering your dog.After the information was gathered, I completed the story, storyboard, filming, and post production editing of this film.
